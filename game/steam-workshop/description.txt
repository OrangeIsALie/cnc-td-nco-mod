[h1]🛠New Construction Options🛠[/h1]

This mod provides an extensive RULES.INI file for Tiberian Dawn & Lua event scripting.

Unfortunately only one dll mod can run at a time, I aim to fix that problem by providing rules and a scripting API. Simply write your mod using this interface instead of editing the source code directly. 

Ever wanted gunboats that can cloak and shoot laser beams❓❓❓
How about capturing a Obelisk with an Engineer❓❓❓
Building Temple of Nod as GDI❓❓❓

[b]You can do all this and more:[/b]

[list]
[*] Set indivual rules for:
  [*] Aircraft
  [*] Infantry
  [*] Units
  [*] Buildings
[*] Turn off single player constraints, for example:
  [*] Nod can't build APCs
  [*] GDI can't build Sandbags until late in the game
[*] Control superweapon logic (only Nukes for now)
[*] Additional rules for cheats and debug options
[/list]

[i]More rules are planned: all superweapons, change graphics, load additional mix files [/i]
